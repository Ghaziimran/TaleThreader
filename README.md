#### Description: Welcome to my Final Project for CS50 called TaleThreader. My project involves me building a story generator for different Genres (Fantasy, Mystery, Romance, Horror). The Web app allows the users to select different difficulty levels (easy, medium and hard) and it dynamically generates a story based on the users choices. 

#### The app utilises javascript to fetch the story content dynamically and in chronological order from seperate HTML files which correspond to each of the genres and difficulty levels, by doing this it ensures there is a seamless and interactive user experience. Flask which is a python framwork handles the routing and the rendering of templates as well as directing to the static files such as styles.css. I have used app.py and falsk to handle the backend side of this project and Javacript to enhance the frontend by dynaically updating the story that needs to be shown.

#### In addition to the story generator for the 4 genres, this project also utillises SQL for data storage and data retrieval to allow for a authentication feature for both login and registration, which allows for users to have a personalised profile.

#### the first page that i created was the app.py which i used to reroute and render the html pages. The first html pages were the index.html and the layout.html page. the index page was at first a very simple formatted page as i prioritised the functionality of the web application before focussing on the design aspects.

#### the first difficulty decision was deciding whether or not to include each individual story on the corresponding genre page or whether or not i should create a seperate folder to hold all the stories. I also faced difficulties here as i hasd to figure out how to reroute to a different folder that includes different files. 

#### the most difficulty part of the project was probably the Javascript itself as to make everything work simulataniously was difficult as if i found a solution to 1 problem another aspect stopped working, however after working on the problems for a few days i finally got everything to work as i knew that if i could successfully complete 1 of the genres, the other 3 would be relativly easier.

#### the next hardest thing was the designing of the project has i had to do lots of research to see how web pages actually looked. only then was i able to get to the final designs of each of the pages.
