# TALETHREADER
#### Description: Welcome to my Final Project for CS50 called TaleThreader. My project involves me building a story generator for different Genres (Fantasy, Mystery, Romance, Horror). The Web app allows the users to select different difficulty levels (easy, medium and hard) and it dynamically generates a story based on the users choices. 

#### The app utilises javascript to fetch the story content dynamically and in chronological order from seperate HTML files which correspond to each of the genres and difficulty levels, by doing this it ensures there is a seamless and interactive user experience. Flask which is a python framwork handles the routing and the rendering of templates as well as directing to the static files such as styles.css. I have used app.py and falsk to handle the backend side of this project and Javacript to enhance the frontend by dynaically updating the story that needs to be shown.

#### In addition to the story generator for the 4 genres, this project also utillises SQL for data storage and data retrieval to allow for a authentication feature for both login and registration, which allows for users to have a personalised profile.
